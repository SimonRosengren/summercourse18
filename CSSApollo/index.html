                    <h2>Apollo program</h2>
                    <p>The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the third United States human spaceflight program
                        carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which accomplished landing
                        the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. First conceived during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration
                        as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man Project Mercury which put the first Americans in
                        space, Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal of "landing a man
                        on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth" by the end of the 1960s, which he proposed in
                        an address to Congress on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded
                        by the two-man Project Gemini conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.</p>
