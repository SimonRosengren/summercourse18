                        <h2>NASA expansion</h2>
                        <p>At the time of Kennedy's proposal, only one American had flown in space—less than a month earlier—and
                            NASA had not yet sent an astronaut into orbit. Even some NASA employees doubted whether Kennedy's
                            ambitious goal could be met.[17] By 1963, Kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint US-USSR
                            Moon mission, to eliminate duplication of effort.[18] With the clear goal of a manned landing
                            replacing the more nebulous goals of space stations and circumlunar flights, NASA decided that,
                            in order to make progress quickly, it would discard the feasibility study designs of Convair,
                            GE, and Martin, and proceed with Faget's command / service module design. The mission module
                            was determined to be only useful as an extra room, and therefore deemed unnecessary.[19] They
                            used Faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids
                            in October 1961. On November 28, 1961, it was announced that North American Aviation had won
                            the contract, although its bid was not rated as good as Martin's. Webb, Dryden and Robert Seamans
                            chose it in preference due to North American's longer association with NASA and its predecessor.[20]
                            Landing men on the Moon by the end of 1969 required the most sudden burst of technological creativity,
                            and the largest commitment of resources ($25 billion; $107 billion in 2016 dollars)[2] ever made
                            by any nation in peacetime. At its peak, the Apollo program employed 400,000 people and required
                            the support of over 20,000 industrial firms and universities.[21] On July 1, 1960, NASA established
                            the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama. MSFC designed the heavy lift-class
                            Saturn launch vehicles, which would be required for Apollo.[22]</p>

                        <h2>Manned Spacecraft Center</h2>
                        <p>It became clear that managing the Apollo program would exceed the capabilities of Robert R. Gilruth's
                            Space Task Group, which had been directing the nation's manned space program from NASA's Langley
                            Research Center. So Gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new NASA center,
                            the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC). A site was chosen in Houston, Texas, on land donated by Rice
                            University, and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19, 1961.[23] It was
                            also clear NASA would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its Cape Canaveral
                            Air Force Station launch facilities in Florida, so a new Mission Control Center would be included
                            in the MSC. In September 1962, by which time two Project Mercury astronauts had orbited the Earth,
                            Gilruth had moved his organization to rented space in Houston, and construction of the MSC facility
                            was under way, Kennedy visited Rice to reiterate his challenge in a famous speech:
                            <blockquote>But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the
                                highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? ... We choose to go to the Moon. We
                                choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy,
                                but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best
                                of our energies and skills; because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept,
                                one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win ... .
                            </blockquote>The MSC was completed in September 1963. It was renamed by the US Congress in honor of Lyndon
                            Johnson soon after his death in 1973.</p>
